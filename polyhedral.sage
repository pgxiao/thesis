    Define a Polyhedral Arrangement.

    INPUT:

    - ``collection`` -- either a list or a tuple or a set of polyhedra, 
    or a dictionary of polyhedra.
    The keys of the dictionary are the dimensions of the polyhedra

    Attributes:

    - ``ambient_dim`` -- the ambient dim of each polyhedron
        
    - ``dim`` -- the maximal dimension among the polyhedra
        
    - ``number_of_polyhedra`` -- the numbers of polyhedra (not including sub-polyhedra)
      when set up the arrangement
    
    - ``grid`` -- a :class:`Grid` that can be used for discrete binary search
      on polyhedra
        
    - ``collection`` -- a dictionary of the polyhedra (not including sub-polyhedra).
    The keys of the dictionary are the dimensions of the polyhedra
